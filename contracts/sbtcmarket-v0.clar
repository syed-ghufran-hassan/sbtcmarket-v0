;; sBTC Prediction Market - Complete Set AMM
;; Implements zero-capital market creation, complete-set mint/burn,
;; constant-product swaps, oracle resolution (Pyth v4), and redemption.
;;
;; ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
;; This contract implements a binary outcome prediction market using two parallel systems:
;;
;; UNITS: All amounts are denominated in SATS (satoshis)
;;   - 1 sBTC = 100,000,000 sats (8 decimals)
;;   - 1 share = 1 sat (share pegged to smallest unit)
;;   - Example: 10,000 sats = 0.0001 sBTC = ~$11 at $110k BTC
;;
;; 1. SHARE ISSUANCE SYSTEM (Real Ownership):
;;    - Tracks shares from complete set minting (yes-issued, no-issued)
;;    - Backed 1:1 by sBTC collateral in the vault
;;    - Complete sets (1 YES + 1 NO) can be minted for 1 sat or burned to redeem 1 sat
;;    - NOTE: Actual circulating shares can exceed yes-issued/no-issued due to swaps!
;;
;; 2. VIRTUAL RESERVE SYSTEM (Pricing Mechanism):
;;    - Uses constant-product AMM formula (price-yes * price-no = k)
;;    - Reserves start at virtual-liquidity parameter (e.g., 10,000,000 sats)
;;    - Reserves change with swaps to reflect market sentiment
;;    - Reserves != issued shares (this is intentional!)
;;
;; KEY INSIGHT: Reserves can be much larger than issued shares because they're a pricing
;; oracle, not a custody mechanism. This enables zero-capital market creation.
;;
;; !!! CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING - OVER-ISSUANCE RISK !!!
;; The swap-shares function can create MORE total shares than vault collateral!
;; This happens when swapping from scarce to abundant side via AMM pricing.
;;
;; Example:
;;   User swaps 1,000 YES -> receives 1,215 NO (net +215 shares)
;;   Vault stays same, but total circulating shares increased by 215!
;;
;; Consequence:
;;   Redemption uses PROPORTIONAL payout: (user_shares / total_circulating) * vault
;;   If total_circulating > vault, users get < 1 sat per share on redemption
;;   Example: 60k shares, 30k vault = 0.5 sats per share redemption ratio
;;
;; Mitigation:
;;   - Proportional redemption ensures fairness (everyone gets same ratio)
;;   - No "race to withdraw" - order doesn't matter
;;   - Users should monitor redemption ratio before resolution
;;
;; See redeem-shares and get-redemption-info for more details.

;; AMM SWAP TRADING
;; ====================================================================================

;; Swap shares from one side to the other using constant-product AMM pricing
;; This is how users change their position without needing a counterparty
;;
;; !!! WARNING: Swaps can create NET NEW SHARES without adding collateral!
;; When swapping from scarce -> abundant side, you receive MORE shares than you burn.
;; This increases total circulating shares above vault collateral (over-issuance).
;; See top-level comments for over-issuance risk explanation.
;;
;; Flow:
;;   1. Calculate fee (e.g., 0.3% of amount-in)
;;   2. Use constant-product formula to determine output
;;   3. Burn user's from-side shares
;;   4. Mint fee shares to treasury (on from-side)
;;   5. Mint output shares to user (on to-side)
;;   6. Update virtual reserves (from-side increases, to-side decreases)
;;
;; Key insight: This DOES affect virtual reserves (unlike mint/burn complete sets)
;; Reserves change to reflect the new market price after the swap
;;
;; Example: swap-shares(from-side: true, amount-in: 1000)
;;   Swapping YES to NO
;;   Reserves: YES=90116, NO=110967
;;   Fee: 1000 * 0.003 = 3 shares
;;   Trade-in: 997 shares (after fee)
;;   Amount-out: ~1215 NO shares (from calculate-amount-out)
;;
;;   User loses: 1000 YES
;;   User gains: 1215 NO
;;   Treasury gains: 3 YES (fee)
;;   New reserves: YES=91113, NO=109752
;;
;; IMPORTANT: This DOES create/destroy shares in user balances, but does NOT update
;; yes-issued/no-issued counts (those only track complete sets).

;; Can only be called after market is resolved

;; If total circulating shares > vault balance, redemption ratio will be < 100%.
;; Use get-redemption-info to check the current redemption ratio before claiming.
;;
;; PROPORTIONAL REDEMPTION:
;;   Instead of first-come-first-serve, everyone gets the same redemption ratio
;;   regardless of when they claim. This is FAIR and eliminates "race to redeem".
;;
;;   Formula: payout = (user_shares / total_circulating) * vault_balance
;;
;;   Example:
;;     - Vault: 30k sats
;;     - Total YES circulating: 60k shares
;;     - Redemption ratio: 30k / 60k = 50%
;;
;;     Alice (20k shares): 20k * 50% = 10k sats

;;     Charlie (20k shares): 20k * 50% = 10k sats
;;
;;     Order doesn't matter - everyone gets same 50% ratio!
;;
;; Mathematical property: The ratio stays constant as people redeem
;;   After Alice redeems: vault=20k, circulating=40k, ratio=50% (same!)

;; CANCELLATION & REFUND MECHANISM
;; ====================================================================================

;; Cancel a market that cannot be resolved
;; Can be called by ANYONE after the 2-block resolution window expires
;; This provides a safety mechanism when:
;;   - Oracle stops publishing price data
;;   - No one has incentive to resolve the market
;;   - Market parameters were incorrect (wrong feed ID, etc.)
;;   - Price data not available at resolution time
;;
;; Once cancelled, users can call refund-shares to get their sBTC back
;;
;; Example timeline:
;;   resolution-block: 890000
;;   Resolution window: 890000-890001 (can resolve)
;;   Block 890002+: Can cancel (resolution-block + CANCEL-TIMEOUT-BLOCKS = 890000 + 2)
;;   Cancellation is available immediately after the resolution window closes

;;   where user_total_shares = user_yes + user_no
;;   and total_circulating = yes_circulating + no_circulating

;;   Vault: 1000 sBTC, Total circulating: 2000 shares (1200 YES + 800 NO)
;;   1. User has 200 YES, 0 NO -> refund (200/2000)*1000 = 100 sBTC
;;   2. User has 100 YES, 100 NO -> refund (200/2000)*1000 = 100 sBTC
;;   3. User has 0 YES, 400 NO -> refund (400/2000)*1000 = 200 sBTC

;; Buy shares on one side using sBTC
;; This is the PRIMARY way users enter positions
;;
;; Tax: 1% tax is deducted upfront and sent to tax-recipient
;;
;; Strategy: "Mint + Swap" pattern (applied to net amount after tax)
;;   1. Deduct 1% tax from sbtc-in
;;   2. Mint complete set with net amount (get equal YES and NO)
;;   3. Swap the unwanted side to get more of the desired side
;;
;; Example: buy-shares(side: true, sbtc-in: 100)
;;   Step 0: Tax deduction
;;     - 1% tax: 1 sBTC sent to tax-recipient
;;     - Net amount: 99 sBTC
;;   Step 1: mint-complete-set(99)
;;     - Pay 99 sBTC (net amount)
;;     - Receive 99 YES + 99 NO
;;   Step 2: swap-shares(from-side: false, amount-in: 99)
;;     - Swap 99 NO to ~120 YES (amount depends on AMM pricing)
;;   Final result:
;;     - You have ~219 YES shares (99 from mint + 120 from swap)
;;     - You spent 100 sBTC total (99 to market + 1 tax)
;;     - Effective price: ~0.46 sBTC per YES share
;;
;; Why this works:
;;   - Complete set minting is always 1:1 (no slippage)
;;   - AMM swap gives you favorable pricing when buying abundant side
;;   - Net result: more shares than simple AMM-only approach

;; Sell shares on one side for sBTC
;; This is the PRIMARY way users exit positions
;;
;; Tax: 1% tax is deducted from the redeemed sBTC amount
;;
;; Strategy: "Swap + Burn" pattern
;;   1. Swap shares from desired side to opposite side
;;   2. Automatically burn any complete sets (matched YES+NO pairs) for sBTC
;;   3. Deduct 1% tax from the burn amount, send tax to tax-recipient
;;
;; Example: sell-shares(side: true, amount: 100)
;;   User has 100 YES, wants to exit
;;   Step 1: swap-shares(from-side: true, amount-in: 100)
;;     - Swap 100 YES to ~82 NO (amount depends on AMM pricing)
;;   Step 2: Check for complete sets
;;     - After swap: might have 50 YES + 82 NO remaining
;;     - Can burn min(50, 82) = 50 complete sets
;;   Step 3: Tax deduction
;;     - Burn amount: 50 sBTC
;;     - 1% tax: 0.5 sBTC sent to tax-recipient
;;     - Net amount: 49.5 sBTC to user
;;   Final result:
;;     - You have 0 YES + 32 NO remaining
;;     - You received 49.5 sBTC (50 - 0.5 tax)
